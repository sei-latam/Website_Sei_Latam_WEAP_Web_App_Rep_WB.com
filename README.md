### Policy for Open Source Contribution (By Original Author)

`I welcome and appreciate contributions in fixing bugs and enhancing features. However, please avoid submitting pull requests (PRs) that modify the template's existing design without discussing them with me. Please do not submit PRs that are not related to bug fixes or feature enhancements. Editing text in the README file is not encouraged (e.g., fixing grammar errors). PRs with unnecessary editing (e.g., adding unrelated text, changing the design of the template, modifying the README text arbitrarily) or unrelated changes (e.g., changes that are related to only their applications) will be marked as "spam" and "invalid".`

`If you are excited to contribute to the new features directly, please explain your design decisions and how your design matches this template's style in the PR. If you fix bugs, please explain which bug you fixed and how you fixed them. The explanations that you put in each PR can greatly help me determine if the changes can be merged into the master branch. PRs with no explanations will highly likely be rejected and marked as "wontfix".`
